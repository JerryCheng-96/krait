# Krait: Microsatellite investigation and primer design

<img src="src/icons/logo.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="6" width="90" height="90">
Krait is a robust and ultrafast tool with a user-friendly graphic interface for genome-wide investigation of microsatellites, which attempts to overcome the limitations of the currently available tools. Krait is written in Python and can be run as a standalone desktop application on Windows, Linux or Mac systems without dependencies. The microsatellite search engine is written in C and compiled as Python modules for import into Krait

# Features
* Identification of perfect SSRs, imperfect SSRs (iSSRs), compound SSRs (cSSRs) and VNTRs from extremely large genome
* Locating the SSRs in gene coding region
* Design primer for microsatellite
* Statistical analysis and plotting
* Supporting gzip compressed fasta as input file
* Supporting export FASTA, GFF3 or CSV
* Downloading DNA sequence from NCBI database
